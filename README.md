# KanaGuess
An Android application that allows users to practice hiragana and katakana recognition and pronunciation.

Hiragana and katakana are two Japanese syllabaries. Both contain symbols representing a consonant sound followed by a vowel sound, such as "ka" or "shi". Outside of the use of kanji (Chinese characters), hiragana are most often used in Japanese, and most words are written in hiragana. On the other hand, katakana are mostly used to write foreign words or to emphasize words normally written in hiragana.

This application tests the character recognition of users by allowing them to select a set of hiragana and katakana, then asking for correct recall of the pronunciation of each character via romaji input (a representation of the character sounds through English characters).
